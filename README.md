# SonsStockMarketGame
This small computer program was something I created to help display the percentage growth my sons had in a 6 week stock market game we did during the COVID 19 pandemic.

I consider myself a beginner, still I would like to share what I used in this program. 

In this program you will find a python list, a python dictionary, a sum of elements in a python list, and of course math sprinkled throughout to calculate the percentage growths respective of the invididual stocks invested in.
